# Portfolio Website

This is a react application that acts as a portfolio of my past and current projects. It will soon be a place for blog posts as sometimes I have something computer-science related that I wish to write and share.

To run this project, clone the repo and direct into it, run `npm install` to the dependencies then run `npm start` to run application. 

The deployed website is located here: https://jammaglobal.github.io/portfolio-site/
